🏏 IPL Data Analysis (2008–2024) | EDA + Power BI Dashboard

                                                              **Project Overview**

This project provides a comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the **Indian Premier League (IPL)** matches played from **2008 to 2024** using Python libraries such as **pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn**. It answers key questions around team and player performances, match outcomes, and trends over the years.

Additionally, a **Power BI dashboard** has been developed to present interactive visual insights about teams, players, and match statistics in a user-friendly format.

### 📊 Objectives

- Analyze team performances: matches played, won, and win percentages.
- Identify **Orange Cap** and **Purple Cap** winners.
- Find players with the most **runs** and **wickets**.
- Perform **toss analysis** to understand winning trends.
- Examine match-wise and season-wise statistics using EDA.
- Present team-wise and player-wise breakdowns with a Power BI dashboard.
